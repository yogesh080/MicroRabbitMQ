# MicroRabbitMQ

This is the practical implementation of RabbitMQ to send the message from 1 microservice to another microservice, we have covered rabbitMQ installation on windows, and then I created 2 microservice for rabbitMQ producer and consumer. The solution created in .net core 3.1, so it has a practical implementation of microservice communication using rabbitMQ MassTransit.
